        "## Project Overview\n",
        "This project aims to enhance family planning (FP) service delivery efficiency by leveraging data-driven approaches, specifically machine learning (ML) using the CRISP-DM methodology. The goal is to improve maternal and child health outcomes, reduce unmet need for family planning, and contribute to achieving national and global development goals related to reproductive health.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "Kenya faces significant strides in increasing access to family planning services, yet a substantial unmet need for family planning remains. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), the total unmet need for family planning is 15%, with 10% for spacing and 5% for limiting births. This indicates that a significant portion of the population desires to space or limit births but is not using any contraceptive method. Traditional methods often show imbalances, with a heavy reliance on short-acting methods, leading to unstable uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods. This disparity can lead to higher discontinuation rates and continued unmet need. Supply chain inefficiencies, commodity stock-outs, inadequate healthcare worker training, and uneven distribution of resources exacerbate these issues, hindering effective service delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Stakeholders\n",
        "* **Government of Kenya:** Ministry of Health (MoH), especially the National Family Planning Coordinated Implementation Plan (NFPICIP) and Kenya Health Information System (KHIS) initiatives.\n",
        "* **Policymakers and Donors:** Need evidence-based advocacy for resource mobilization and investment.\n",
        "* **Healthcare Providers:** Frontline health workers providing FP services.\n",
        "* **Women of Reproductive Age:** Direct beneficiaries of improved FP services.\n",
        "* **Local Communities:** Impacted by and involved in FP service delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Statistics\n",
        "* **Total Unmet Need for Family Planning (2022 KDHS):** 15%\n",
        "    * **Unmet Need for Spacing:** 10%\n",
        "    * **Unmet Need for Limiting Births:** 5%\n",
        "* **Married Women Aged 15-49 Rising to 57% in 2022 (DRS 2022):**  Modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR).\n",
        "* **Number of new clients for FP method band and the continuation rate:** Key data points for predicting future demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Analytics Questions\n",
        "* How many new clients are expected for injectables in a County next quarter?\n",
        "* What is the projected demand for different family planning methods (injectables, pills, condoms, implants, IUD, sterilization) at various geographical (e.g., county) and temporal (e.g., quarterly, annual) granularities?\n",
        "* How can we optimize resource allocation (commodities, equipment, staffing) to meet projected demand and minimize wastage?\n",
        "* How can predictive analytics identify potential stock-outs or oversupply of specific FP commodities in different locations?\n",
        "* Which regions or demographics are most underserved in terms of family planning access and uptake?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "* **Quantitatively forecast the demand for specific family planning methods:** This includes predicting the continuation rates of users for each method at defined geographical and temporal scales.\n",
        "* **Enable proactive resource allocation:** This involves optimizing the distribution of commodities, equipment, and staffing to reduce stock-outs, minimize wastage, and improve targeted interventions.\n",
        "* **Improve method continuation:** By understanding demand and improving service delivery, the project aims to reduce discontinuation rates and increase sustained use of FP methods.\n",
        "* **Provide evidence-based insights:** Support policymakers and donors in making informed decisions regarding resource mobilization and investment in family planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Metrics of Importance to Focus On\n",
        "* **Accuracy of Demand Forecasts:** Measured by comparing predicted demand with actual uptake for various FP methods at different geographical and temporal levels (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).\n",
        "* **Commodity Stock-out Rates:** Reduction in the number or duration of stock-outs for essential family planning commodities.\n",
        "* **Resource Utilization Efficiency:** Metrics related to optimal allocation and reduced wastage of commodities, equipment, and human resources.\n",
        "* **Method Continuation Rates:** Increase in the percentage of users who continue using a specific family planning method over a defined period (e.g., 12-month continuation rate).\n",
        "* **Unmet Need for Family Planning:** Contribution to the reduction of the national unmet need for family planning.\n",
        "* **Client Satisfaction:** Indirectly improved through better access and availability of preferred methods.\n",
        "* **Healthcare Worker Productivity:** Optimized allocation of staff to meet demand efficiently."
